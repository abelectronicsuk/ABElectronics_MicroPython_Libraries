================================================
ABElectronics ADC Pi TMP36 temperature sensor demo for MicroMicroPython Library

Run using Thonny Python IDE from https://thonny.org/

Create ADCPi.py file and copy contents from  ADCPi.py to file and save
onto Raspberry Pi Pico

Create file named demo_tmp36.py and copy code from this file and save
onto Raspberry Pi Pico

Run with "Run Current Command" or F5 in Thonny

================================================

Initialise the ADC device using the default addresses and sample rate,
change this value if you have changed the address selection jumpers

Sample rate can be 12,14, 16 or 18
