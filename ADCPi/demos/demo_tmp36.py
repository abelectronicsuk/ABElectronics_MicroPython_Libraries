================================================
ABElectronics ADC Pi TMP36 temperature sensor demo for MicroPython Library

Run using Thonny Python IDE from https://thonny.org/

Create a file in Thonny called ADCPi.py, copy contents from ADCPi.py 
to the file and save it onto the Raspberry Pi Pico

Create a file named demo_tmp36.py, copy the code from this file and save
onto the Raspberry Pi Pico

Run with "Run Current Command" or F5 in Thonny

================================================

Initialise the ADC device using the default addresses and sample rate,
change this value if you have changed the address selection jumpers

The sample rate can be 12, 14, 16 or 18
